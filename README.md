*"Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface."* - Doug McIlroy, 1978

An AI agent in 6,832 bytes of x86-64 assembly. No libc, no runtime, no allocator. Just Linux syscalls.

PlanckClaw takes the Unix philosophy at its word. The agent is a single binary that does one thing: route. It reads messages from a pipe, writes prompts to a pipe, reads responses from a pipe, dispatches tool calls to a pipe. It doesn't know what platform it talks to, what LLM it thinks with, or what tools it has. Four processes, six named pipes, zero shared state. Composition over complexity. Pipes over protocols. `sh` over frameworks.

Modern AI agent frameworks ship hundreds of megabytes of runtimes, package managers, and abstraction layers before a single token is generated. LangChain alone pulls in 400+ transitive dependencies. PlanckClaw asks the question that [Worse is Better](https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html) asked in 1989: what happens when you choose simplicity - in the interface *and* the implementation - above all else?

The entire runtime fits in ~23 KB. That's the binary, the bridges, the tools, the config. It fits on a 1.44 MB floppy disk 62 times. Run `make size` to verify.

***This is a thought experiment, not production-ready software.***

## features

- **Tool use**: the agent discovers available tools at each message and uses Claude's [tool_use](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use) protocol to call them. Ships with `get_time` and `system_status`.
- **Hot-reload extensibility**: add a tool by dropping a shell script in `claws/`. No restart, no recompilation, no config file.
- **Long-term memory**: conversation history persists across restarts in append-only JSONL.
- **Automatic compaction**: when history grows past a threshold, old conversations are summarized by the LLM and stored as compressed context.
- **Personality**: edit `memory/soul.md` to change who the agent is. Injected into every API call.
- **Swappable bridges**: CLI, Discord, or write your own. Pass as argument to the launcher.
- **Debug mode**: `PLANCKCLAW_DEBUG=1` dumps API payloads and HTTP status to stderr.
- **Zero dependencies**: the agent binary is fully static. No libc, no allocator, no runtime.

## quick start

Start with defaults : Anthropic LLM + CLI

```sh
git clone https://github.com/frntn/plankclaw.git && cd plankclaw
./configure                          # check prerequisites
make                                 # build the ~7KB binary
cp config.env.example config.env     # add your Anthropic API key
./planckclaw.sh                      # run in terminal mode by default
```

Extend using Discord bridge (require `jq` and `websocat`)

```sh
./planckclaw.sh bridge_discord.sh    # discuss via Discord (not CLI)
```

You'll need `nasm`, `curl`, `jq`, and `websocat` installed (see [install](#install) below).

## what is this

The name comes from the [Planck length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length), the smallest meaningful scale in physics. PlanckClaw is the smallest meaningful AI agent we could build: a return to [the Art of Unix Programming](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/), where small sharp tools compose through text streams and the [Rule of Least Mechanism](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html#id2878263) governs every design decision.

The agent binary does no networking and executes no tools. It is a pure router (the `cat` of AI agents). Read a message from one pipe, ask another pipe what tools exist, build a prompt, write it to a third pipe, parse the response, dispatch tool calls, relay the answer. All of this with raw `read`/`write`/`open`/`close` syscalls. No `malloc`. No `printf`. No libc at all. The binary is fully static and has zero runtime dependencies.

Everything else is composed around it, the way [Doug McIlroy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy) intended:

- `bridge_discord.sh`: Discord Gateway via WebSocket (~180 lines of `sh`)
- `bridge_cli.sh`: terminal interface (~40 lines of `sh`)
- `bridge_brain.sh`: `curl`s the Anthropic API (~90 lines of `sh`)
- `bridge_claw.sh`: tool discovery and dispatch (~50 lines of `sh`)
- `planckclaw.sh`: creates pipes, starts processes, cleans up (~90 lines of `sh`)

The total codebase is ~2,800 lines. The compiled binary is 6,832 bytes. It runs in ~200 KB of resident memory. There is no build system beyond a 6-line Makefile. The `./configure` is 30 lines of readable `sh`, not 10,000 lines of autoconf. No `cmake`. No `package.json`. Just `nasm`, `ld`, and `make`.

The point is not that you should write your agents in assembly. The point is that you *can*, that the core logic of an AI agent (read, think, act, remember, respond) is simple enough to fit in a few kilobytes of machine code. Everything else is ceremony.

```

Four processes, six named pipes. The agent never touches the network. The bridges never touch the state. Clean separation.

- **Agent** (`planckclaw`): the ~7KB binary. Pure router: reads messages, discovers tools, builds API payloads, parses responses, dispatches tool calls, persists history and memory. Written in x86-64 assembly. No networking, no tool execution.
- **Bridge Interact** (`bridge_discord.sh` or `bridge_cli.sh`): swappable. `bridge_discord.sh` connects to Discord via WebSocket. `bridge_cli.sh` provides a terminal interface. Pass as argument to `planckclaw.sh`.
- **Bridge Brain** (`bridge_brain.sh`): reads JSON payloads from `brain_in`, sends them to the Anthropic Messages API via `curl`, writes responses to `brain_out`. Retries on failure.
- **Bridge Claw** (`bridge_claw.sh`): scans `claws/*.sh` for tool definitions on `__list_tools__` (builtins, zero fork), dispatches tool calls to matching claw scripts. Hot-reload: add/remove a file, the next message sees the change.

## tools

What makes PlanckClaw an *agent* rather than a chatbot is tool use. At each message, the agent asks the claw bridge for available tools via the `__list_tools__` discovery protocol and injects them into the Claude API request using the standard [tool use](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use) protocol.

PlanckClaw ships with two default claws in the `claws/` directory:

| Tool | Claw file | What it returns |
|---|---|---|
| `get_time` | `claws/time.sh` | Current Unix timestamp |
| `system_status` | `claws/system.sh` | Uptime, RAM total/free, 1-min load average, process count |

When the LLM decides it needs information, it returns `stop_reason: "tool_use"` instead of text. The agent detects this, dispatches the call to the claw bridge via FIFO, and sends the result back in a `tool_result` message. The LLM then generates its final response using the real data.

### extensibility

Adding a new tool is simple, just drop a file in `claws/`:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
#TOOLS:{"name":"my_tool","description":"What it does","input_schema":{"type":"object","properties":{}}}

case "$1" in
    my_tool) printf 'result here' ;;
esac
```

Make it executable (`chmod +x`) and you're done. The claw bridge scans `claws/*.sh` at each message using shell builtins (zero fork for discovery). No recompilation, no config file, no restart needed — hot-reload is built in.

### limitations

The default tools are deliberately minimal. PlanckClaw is a thought experiment, not a framework. But the architecture supports any tool (filesystem access, HTTP requests, command execution) by adding a claw file. The core stays under 8KB. Forever.

## memory

The agent maintains three files:

- `memory/soul.md`: system prompt, personality. You write this; the agent reads it on startup and injects it into every API call.
- `memory/history.jsonl`: full conversation log, append-only JSONL. One line per message, alternating user/assistant roles.
- `memory/summary.md`: compacted memory. When history exceeds `HISTORY_MAX` lines (default: 200), the agent sends old conversations to the LLM for summarization, keeps the last `HISTORY_KEEP` lines (default: 40), and stores the summary here. Next conversations include the summary as context.

This gives the agent long-term memory that survives restarts and grows without bound (thanks to compaction). Edit `soul.md` to change who the agent is. Delete `history.jsonl` and `summary.md` to wipe its memory.

## configuration

Environment variables in `config.env`:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | Discord bot token | (required for Discord) |
| `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` | Channel to listen on | (required for Discord) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic API key | (required) |
| `PLANCKCLAW_DIR` | Memory directory | `./memory` |
| `HISTORY_MAX` | Lines before compaction | `200` |
| `HISTORY_KEEP` | Lines kept after compaction | `40` |
| `PLANCKCLAW_DEBUG` | Enable debug logging (`1` = on) | `0` |

## install

**Build tools** (to compile the agent):

```sh
sudo apt install nasm binutils make    # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install nasm binutils make    # Fedora
```

**Runtime tools** (to run):

```sh
sudo apt install curl jq               # Debian/Ubuntu
```

Plus [websocat](https://github.com/vi/websocat), grab a binary from the releases page. It's a single static binary (the Unix way).

You'll also need a [Discord bot token](https://discord.com/developers/applications) with the Message Content intent enabled, and an [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/).
